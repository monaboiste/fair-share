/**
 * Semantic interpretation of calculator's result.
 *
 * <p>The same mathematical function can have different meanings: - TOTAL: total cost for given quantity/time - UNIT:
 * average price per single unit - MARGINAL: price of n-th specific unit
 *
 * <p>This enum captures the MEANING of the calculated Money value, not just the numeric result.
 *
 * <p>Example: Step function: f(q) = base + ⌊q/step⌋ × increment - Interpreted as TOTAL → "Total cost for q units" -
 * Interpreted as UNIT → "Average price per unit when buying q" - Interpreted as MARGINAL → "Price of the q-th unit"
